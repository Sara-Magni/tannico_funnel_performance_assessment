## 🎯 INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES

## **INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES: STRATEGIC FOCUS ON STILL WINE**

According to the OIV (International Organisation of Vine and Wine), still wine (red and white) constitutes 89% of global production and consumption volume, representing the volumetric base of the market [1]. Premium categories – particularly sparkling wines, champagne, and spirits – while representing approximately 11% of total volume, generate 25% of export value thanks to average prices 2.3 times higher (€8.20/L vs €3.62/L) [2].

In the retail market, this dynamic is reflected in margins: while mass-market wines (under $15) achieve margins of 30-40%, premium and luxury wines reach margins of 45-70%, confirming the principle of "volume on still, margin on premium" [3]. Wineries specializing in premium segments record gross margins up to 57.5%, approximately 15 percentage points higher than standard producers [4].

In the on-premise channel (restaurants, bars), this differentiation is even more pronounced: markups on standard still wine range from 200-300%, while champagne and specialty wines can reach 400%, generating operating margins up to 70% - the most profitable category on the entire food & beverage menu [5].

**Strategic Rationale:** Based on this established market structure, the primary strategic focus is positioned on still wine (Reds, Whites) as the volume and market penetration driver, while premium categories (Sparkling, Champagne, Spirits) represent the lever for margin optimization and brand positioning. This strategy aligns with the best practices of global industry leaders such as LVMH (Moët Hennessy), Campari Group, and Pernod Ricard, which balance high-volume portfolios with high-margin premium products [8].
